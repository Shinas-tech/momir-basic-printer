## About

Downloads card data from the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) and prints a random card on demand when a button is pressed. The card images are converted to monochrome and printed using a thermal receipt printer. The card name is also displayed on an OLED screen.

### Pinout

...

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MoritzHayden/momir-basic-printer.git
cd momir-basic-printer
```

2. Open [src/config.ini](src/config.ini) in a text editor and update the configuration variables to add your specific settings (like printer connection details, GPIO pins, and other hardware settings) before proceeding.

```shell
nano src/config.ini
```

3. Make the setup script executable and run it. This will automatically install dependencies and configure the systemd background service.

```shell
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

_(Note: If you are running a minimal setup and explicitly require the service to run as root, you can bypass the safety check by running `sudo ./setup.sh --allow-root`)_

## Service Management

View live logs and print statements:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u momir-basic-printer.service -f
```

Check the current status of the service:

```shell
sudo systemctl status momir-basic-printer.service
```

Restart the service (required after making code changes):

```shell
sudo systemctl restart momir-basic-printer.service
```

Stop the service:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop momir-basic-printer.service
```

## Momir Basic Rules
